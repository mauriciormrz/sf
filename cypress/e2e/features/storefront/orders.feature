Feature: Shopping
    As a YL customer,
    I want to add some items to the shopping cart,
    So I can place an order.

    Background:
        Given I am at the Login page
        And I log in to the Storefront with user "5010"  and password "Password1"

    Scenario Outline: Order Placed with "<shipping_method>" Shipping, "<payment_method>" Payment and Donation="<donation>"
        When I add the item to the shopping cart
            | sku  | item              | quantity | price | pv   |
            | 3419 | RutaVaLa Essential Oil | 1        | 33.75 | 33.75 |
            #| 5203 | Lavender Lip Balm | 1        | 4.25  | 4.25 |


        And I checkout the order with donation "<donation>"
        Then I fill the checkout form with "<shipping_method>" and "<payment_method>"
        And I should see the order confirmation "THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING YOUNG LIVING."
